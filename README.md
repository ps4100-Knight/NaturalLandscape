# 3D Realistic NaturalLandscape

This is one of the first UE4 projects I worked on. I used the quixell assets to create a realistic environment. For the terrain I used Gaea to create realistic mountain, river and lake systems and oceans. I also created texture masks by performing arithmatic operations on the Gaea outputs using ImageJ.

The part I am proud of the is AutoLandscape material that I created that can paint any terrain automatically once supplied with relevent texture masks. The material is highly customizable as each layer has seperate parameters for normals and world deformation. 
I also created a highly realistic water shader that has most properties real life water has when interacting with lights.
Near the end of the project I also brought it to VR as I wanted to (literally)setp into the world that I created.
Here are some of the amazing renders I was able to get from this projct.

P.S. At the time when I created this project I didn't care for the source control as it was a solo project. But then it became into something I can show off and so I put it on github. With high fidelity assets though the files were too big and I had to use git LFS but my project being at a stage where it was bigger then the allowed daily bandwitdth on git LFS I couldn't fully upload it here. I tried many different ways to no avail but as you can see the results are greate.
